## Overview

For the Frontend Mentor IP Address Tracker challenge, I created a IP Address Tracker that allows users to tracke IP Address for various purposes. The goal of this project was to practice building responsive and visually appealing components using HTML and CSS. I aimed to create a clean and user-friendly interface for tracking IP Address.

  - **2. Accessibility:** Ensuring that the component is accessible to users with disabilities by implementing proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.
<br>

  - **3. Cross-browser Compatibility:** Testing the component on various web browsers and ensuring it works seamlessly on different platforms.
